Introduction

This capstone project is about using what people talk on stocktwit.com about stocks, and using it to predict the stock market. 

The core data used on this project are obtained from both the stocktwits.com and yahoofinances.com. To get user data, stocktwit api was used. Here is an example of a person mentioning a stock. 

Process

Here is a list of actions performed to obtain our final result.

Scrape stocktwit data from its API based on the stock ticker
Get their set sentiment, and also derive their sentiment based on their message by using bag of words method.
Scale sentiments from [0 to 1]
add stocks prices to corresponding days based on  the stock ticker
Once the data is cleaned, use linear regression to predict stock values for the given number of days.
