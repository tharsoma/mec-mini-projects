The price action in the broader markets looks like a wave 4. With that in mind, I&#39;m looking at this chart with the idea that a wave 4 triangle is taking place since earnings. It should be complete or complete with one more quick red print in the AM. I&#39;m bullish because I expect another rally to new highs, but bearish because it could be the entire top of the market. The top of the next leg will definitely be an objective short entry.   \n",
