I rarely make updates lately because I&#39;m not very happy about my returns. I&#39;m more motivated to make updates when we do great.

It&#39;s the choice I made to protect my portfolio and I&#39;m sticking with it. I don&#39;t care if it doesn&#39;t pay off right away, I&#39;m a patient investor. At least we&#39;re still making small gains and protecting our portfolio while we wait for better entries/opportunities. My other portfolio which is mostly long equity (especially in GAMMA (GOOG, $AAPL, MSFT, META, $AMZN) &amp; semiconductors ($NVDA, $TSM, $AMD, ASML, etc.) was on fire today. I don&#39;t chase, I simply wait to allocate more when opportunities come to us. Until then we&#39;ll have to settle with our smaller gains.
