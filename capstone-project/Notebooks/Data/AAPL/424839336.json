I mentioned we would probably begin the year with a move to 480 on the SPY but that would most likely be our last leg higher. It was my belief that yields were going to rise and the first half of the year would most likely offer a 10%+ correction. I said last Sunday that we would breach the 50 day EMA (which we closed at Friday) and test our 200 day EMA. \n\nIn the past I&#39;ve used BTC/cryptos as well as TSLA as my sentiment indicators. And while TSLA (as well stks like AAPL) has held up well, the crypto mkt has been crumbling with an enormous amount of new investors  wiped out. \n\nWhere to from here? Do we bounce?
