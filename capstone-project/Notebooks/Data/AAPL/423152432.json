Not having enough to be nearly as comfortable as they\u2019d like.  If you get this than you have to forego that etc. So it\u2019s natural to be concerned about money for many boomers.

You\u2019re lucky to be smart enough to think about it. But don\u2019t do me any favors and buy these pumped stocks if you don\u2019t want them. Buy Spce or whatever. Thing is if these pumped stocks go south you\u2019ve got decades to recoup your loss. We don\u2019t have that recoup time. Like zero or close to it.
