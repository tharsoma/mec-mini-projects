We saw a similar selloff in early 2020 and early 2021 from rising yields. After a few days decline, what did asset managers do? Jump back into the stock market, particularly in techs. For those who are a bit less experienced, let me reassure you, systemic selling by institutions and larger asset managers have not occurred because the volume shows it is relatively low. The problem is lake of liquidity due to buyers. So drop in prices are enhanced when sellers are taking profits.
