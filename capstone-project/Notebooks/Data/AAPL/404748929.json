READ THIS\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5I\u2019m betting that apple will never see 200 until next year, around summer. This won\u2019t see 160 before 2022.  And it won\u2019t break 155 by Xmas.  Not trying to be bearish but this is the worst company to buy calls and puts in.  If you gonna buy apple, buy shares.  This is too manipulated to make any money. Think about it. Last week y\u2019all bought over 200k calls to hit 152.80.  Didn\u2019t happen. Almost 300k calls  to hit 155. Didn\u2019t happen. This week there is a combined 500k calls to hit 151.50 to 155.00 and this won\u2019t happen again.
