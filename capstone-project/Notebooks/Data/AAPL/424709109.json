To think, that we can perhaps gain even +2 to the  multiple, it represents an advance of 12 dollars almost, setting a PT close to $184. Apple already has had a 7% correction from its ATH, while Ultra growth stocks rallied today. \n\nApple commanded a PE of 25x in Jan 2020, before the printers were turned on. We can all agree Apple has a much better balance sheet since then and is ever closer to new verticals which demand a new valuation multiple. If all else fails, you can play the earnings hype.
