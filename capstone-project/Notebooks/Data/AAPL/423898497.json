Hall said that such figures likely result from supply constraints and increased delays in product shipments, and such matters will determine whether product lead times return to normal levels this month.\n\nWith regards to the MacBook, Hall said lead times for new MacBook Pro laptops remain elevated, but have improved slightly over the holiday week. Hall said that such a situation suggests improvements in supply levels of Apple&#39;s (AAPL) proprietary M1 Pro processor.\n\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3785468-apple-seeing-improvement-in-post-holiday-iphone-supplies", "time": 1641453947.0, "crested_time": "2022-01-05T23:25:47Z", "sentiment": ""}, {"id": 423907495, "text": "$AAPL this garbage company ruined the stock market with its valuation.
