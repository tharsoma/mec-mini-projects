[{"id": 405362151, "text": "$STRR here\u2019s some interesting charts. $STRR for quarterly growth, there is huge growth recently about the same as 2016 levels when the stock was trading at $60 a share. Especially looking at the third chart. Now the stock trades around $2.50. What\u2019s even more interesting is the revenue for the year of 2015 was only around 50 mil, now revenue is around 120 mil a year for 2021. Also, the company had a 36 mil loss for the year 2017 in net income, the stock was still at $40 a share. Company has drastically reduced that, and may be profitable very soon. Just sharing some DD for $STRR as it has a 13 mil market cap and around 120 mil in revenues. opinions of course \n$SPY $TSLA $UUU $AAPL", "time": 1636956483.0, "crested_time": "2021-11-14T22:08:03Z", "sentiment": "Bullish"}, {"id": 405361489, "text": "$AAPL AAPL 2021-11-14 Daily Forecast Video: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgtUH87GY2I", "time": 1636956246.0, "crested_time": "2021-11-14T22:04:06Z", "sentiment": ""}, {"id": 405360918, "text": "$AAPL Bears sweating after that $175 UBS PT Upgrade this morning, should see a nice bounce to $160 by EOW \ud83d\udc4d\n\nhttps://pulse2.com/apple-nasdaq-aapl-stock-175-price-target-from-ubs/", "time": 1636956047.0, "crested_time": "2021-11-14T22:00:47Z", "sentiment": "Bullish"}, {"id": 405359984, "text": "$AAPL was analyzed by 48 analysts.
