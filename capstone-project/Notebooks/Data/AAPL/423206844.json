Here was a company that under produced and had people lining up waiting for the new releases. I thought that was smart. Indeed, far as the iphone goes, it has, in a way becomes the companies attention getter for bringing new people intoit&#39;s ecosystem. That is why they&#39;ve started putting out lower cost models to gain market share. They want to keep growing the hugh numbers of brand loyal life long customers... For over five decades I refused to even try another brand of ketchup or mayonnaise.
