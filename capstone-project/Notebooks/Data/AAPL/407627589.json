First off, we popped the ATH cherry today leaving us primed to squeeze above due to the absurd amount of options expiring in the money tomorrow. With this squeeze we have news of Apple allowing self-repair of devices which you might think is a nothingburger, right? Wrong, bitch. For those with critical thinking skills, I see this as (a) avoidance of lawsuit and thereby expenses (b) appealing to the demands of shareholders and (c) most fucking importantly of all, it means they have the supply to allow for such repair meaning they\u2019re skirting by the supply chain shortage. Furthermore we get this Apple car shit which honestly, could not care less out of all the reasons. It\u2019ll be slick but let\u2019s focus on the other fact that it\u2019s holiday szn and Apple is gonna be under so many fucking trees this year. \n\nAlright I\u2019m about to wipe so I can\u2019t type much more.
