However, now that ATH and 3 Trillion have been hit the question is where to now? Under normal circumstances I&#39;d be looking for a bit of a pullback, first to $181.33 (last weeks high) and if that breaks then the $180-ish area. However, the 10 Year bond is going absolutely bonkers today (up 8.9% as I write this) which is a HUGE move. Whether the market on the whole can continue upward in the face of a bond move of that magnitude remains to be seen. However, having said that, I&#39;m still constructive on continued upward movement on a retest (and hold) of the 180-ish area.
