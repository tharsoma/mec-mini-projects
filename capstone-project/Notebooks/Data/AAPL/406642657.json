JAMF dropped from $48 last week when it should have traded higher into the $50s. There is a chance that JAMF could recover everything that it lost last week, and then some. $50+ is possible. Considering the company beat on revenues, beat on guidance, had record ARR up 24% YOY, and ARR was up 30% from the previous quarter, with other key metrics in the ER coming in very positive... JAMF shares really should have traded higher from $48 last week on the strong ER, and the positive Apple announcement.
