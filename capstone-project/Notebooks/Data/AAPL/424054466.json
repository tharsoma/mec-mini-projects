Look at the fed rates in dotcom bust in 2000 and housing crash in 2008. The problem isn\u2019t just the rate increase, but the situation. While rate hikes ultimately caused both events, during dotcom, lenders borrowed money left to right for tech startups, and when rates jumped, techs who did not make profit could not pay back loans, and defaulted. Housing crash was similar as lenders borrowed money on adjustable with no income verification. When rates jumped, ppl defaulted. Right now, companies have the largest cash on hand. Fed expects 3 increase in 2023 and 2 in 2024, that will leave fed rates at around 2.1% by end of 2024. Compare that to the 6%+ during housing and dotcom bust, and now look at the different fundamentals. Do you actually believe we have the same risk as 2000 and 2008?
