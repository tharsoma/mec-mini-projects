It does not come close to meeting the needs of the middle or high end of the market. Only the low end of the market would consider ABE. Then as a small business grows, it will have to graduate up to the next level of service and support, which is Jamf. ABE works for the benefit of Jamf to grow the market, and then these new customers seek a viable solution with Jamf. Apple is out of its core area of expertise will never really get any meaningful ROI in this new space for Apple&#39;s earnings. This is a loser for Apple. Jamf&#39;s growth is now accelerating as ABE helps grow the overall market. The chart below is the dip that traders dream of finding. I am in below $32, added to my position today. Needham $55 price target now needs to be raised higher as ABE drives additional growth.
