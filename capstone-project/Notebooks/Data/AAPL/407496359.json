Yesterday we dipped about 4% and this board looked like we were losing all our money. I get the feel that too many of us are holding options, not shares, thus are constantly stressed by the small moves. I\u2019ve done this before and executed many thousands of percent returns, buy shares and hold them. $abnb is growing at 300% with a brilliant ceo. Don\u2019t try to game the system with options. Invest with conviction and hold long so we can all be happy together in a few years. So this is my call to options holders with a bullish bias to just buy shares and help fund this project. I own about 10,000 shares and no 4% down day after a 50% run is gonna get me to paper hands my shares. Let\u2019s work together.
